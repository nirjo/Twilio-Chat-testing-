# TwilioReactChatApp

I made this for an article published to Twilio.

Run `yarn start` inside sdk-starter-node to start the backend,
then you can run `yarn dev` inside frontend to start the app.

Use git clone https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/sdk-starter-node.git to use sdk-starter-node, provided by Twilio
